    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <b>Define internet backbone in your own words.</b>
    <p1>The internet backbone is a series of routers that connect to fibre-optic cables. These cables are the main way by which data is transferred around the world. The internet backbone connects the continents via underwater cables, and is built with backup routes in the case of a cable failure.</p1>
  
    <b>What is the difference between clients and servers on the internet?</b>
    <p1>A client is the side of an exchange of data on the internet that recieves or requests data from a server. The server is the side which sends data to a client. The two can be compared to a cashier (server) and customer (client). </p1>
    <p><b>Draw or describe how servers, routers, switches, work stations, and other hardware components are part of the internet.</b></p>
    <p>Data is produced by servers, which then are translated to energy or light; also known as 'bits'. A router allows cross-network data transfer, and a network switch trafficks the data between clients</p>
    <p><b>Describe the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) model of networking, in general terms, outlining how this protocol provides the data transfer mechanism required to establish client/server relationships.</b></p>
    <p>The Internet Protocol Suite describes a set of protocols, rules that computers must follow in order to ensure that the data they transfer is correct, to the right place, and to the right time. IP ensures data gets to the right place, TCP ensures it is in the correct order and none is missing.</p>
    <p><b>List at least three examples of internet services that rely on client/server relationships.</b></p>
    <p>Video games, Streaming sites, Forums</p>
    <p><b>What is hypertext?</b></p>
    <p>Text that can be clicked on to open a link. Often used in wikipedia and forums</p>
    <p><b>How is “the web” related to the internet?</b></p>
    <p>The web functions off of the internet: it displays and provides access to search engines, emails, and the like. </p>
    <p><b>Explain how the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is used to facilitate client/server interaction.</b></p>
    <p>HTTP is used to display webpages, particularly those with hypertext.</p>
    <p><b>What is HTTP and how is it different from HTTPS?</b></p>
    <p>HTTP has no encryption capabilities, whereas HTTPS does.</p>
    <p><b>Describe and illustrate the development of the Web in general terms using the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 generational paradigms.</b></p>
    <ul>The most basic framework of the internet was the Web 1.0 framework. This framework included very simple pages, limited design features, and little capability for social interaction. Considering this to be the first web framework, web 1.0 was impressive.</ul>
    <ul>The next framework of the internet arrived; the Web 2.0. Included were ease of access to more parts of the internet, social interaction and commenting, content that responds to user input, and integrated APIs. The first blogging and social media sites started appearing.</ul>
    <ul>Web 3.0 is different from the other frameworks, as this one has not been released and is more theoretical than anything. It involves integrating cryptocurrency and the blockchain to the internet, improved data access for AI, 3D graphics and ubiquity.</ul>
    <p><b>Compare and contrast the Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0 stages of development.</b></p>
    <p>Web 1.0 focuses on read-only websites and very static web design. Web 2.0 focuses on accessibility, social interaction, and data exchange. Web 3.0 is purported to improve automation and customization, while focusing on decentralization.</p>
    <p><b>Describe the role markup languages play in the Web.</b></p>
    Inhibit structure and layout of web pages in a way typically more simple than scripting languages.
    <p><b>Compare and contrast markup and scripting languages</b></p>
    <p>Markup languages are the main way text and images are displayed on the internet, but are static. Scripting languages, though are dynamic, and can respond to events, logic, or user data. Both are important to web development, and both function off specific keywords and syntax.</p>
    <p><b>Explain the relationship between Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), Extensible Markup Language (XML), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language (DHTML), and markdown (MD).</b></p>
    XML is used for storing data, HTML is used for displaying text, XHTML is considered a 'stricter' version of HTML, Markdown is for formatting text, DHTML combines capabilities of HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create highly functional webpages with ease, and SGML serves as a standard, human-and-machine readable language.
    <p><b>List some of your own interests, values, beliefs, resources, prior learning and experiences.</b></p>
    <p>I love playing video games, namely minecraft, namely-ER modded minecraft. However, I have had to become familiar with some computer troubleshooting, as I used to load mods manually. After I became tired of dealing with manual minecraft mods, though, I decided to download a modloader, which only took an entire day of troubleshooting ;-; (I can't even remember what was wrong, but I did fix it :3). Enough about modded minecraft, though- I also took a CTS class in grade 6 and- while it was rudimentary- I learnt some HTML code.</p>
    <p><b>Describe how CSE1210 may connect to your future occupational choices.</b></p>
    <p>After high school, I will be pursuing a career in history. Likely, I will become an archaeologist. As I understand it, only a part of the job of an archaeologist is to dig for artefacts- they also have to write detailed descriptions and catalog their findings. If this is the case, I will have a leg up- from what I learn from this class i'm certain I will have an improved capacity for knowledge on whatever filing system I end up using.</p>
